Anatomy, physiology, psychiatry, pharmacology, veterinary and neurology should be found here.
May be this package should be named org.jscience.health (although, clearly, this is not the name of a science).

Ontology for anatomy:

The thing is that we have not found any definitive list of muscles:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_muscles_in_the_human_body
or http://www.lumen.luc.edu/lumen/meded/grossanatomy/dissector/mml/index.htm

Therefore, we have not put them into XML waiting to have only the meaningful and authorative data.

For the same reason it was not possible to produce a list of nerves, arteries or cutaneous information:
http://www.lumen.luc.edu/lumen/meded/grossanatomy/learnem/learnit.htm

Though there is a list of brain region available at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_regions_in_the_human_brain or http://anatomy.uams.edu/anatomyhtml/brain.html

There is nevertheless something very good at http://anatomy.uams.edu/anatomyhtml/gross.html


If you manage to have some good data sources or have converted these txt files to XML, let us know.
