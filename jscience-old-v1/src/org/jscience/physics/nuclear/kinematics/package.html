<p>This package contains some class which are duplicated from classes in other packages, especially in mathematics and
    statistics and also in nuclear chemistry (particle, nucleus).
    In other words, integration with other packages is incomplete.

<p>
    Moreover, the graphic components are not completly separated from the computation API (for example spanc class).

<p>
    Yet this is not that dramatic. Let us know if you really have problems with this.
