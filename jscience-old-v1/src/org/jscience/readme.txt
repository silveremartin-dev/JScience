Jscience is a general scientific library in Java.
- Actually, your basic survival kit as a developer looking for science -



This is the readme.txt file for JScience (http://jade.dev.java.net/) version 1.0 beta 1 EXPERIMENTAL, as of 20th November 2007.


We have currently released (in the "documents and files" section of http://jade.dev.java.net) all four planned distributions:
- level 1 release for environments short on memory (PDA...) which contains awt, help, io, mathematics, measure.random, media, ml (xml parsers), net, swing, text and util packages.
- level 2 release which contains the level 1 and architecture, astronomy, bibliography, chemistry, computing, devices, earth (but not weather subpackage), engineering and physics.
- level 3 release which contains the level 2 and arts, biology, earth.weather, economics, geography, history, law, linguistics, measure (and subpackages but random which is already in level 1), medicine, philosophy, politics, psychology, sociology and sports.

(There is also a distribution 
containing only the data files for people not interested in the Java library.)


WARNINGS:
1.
- Currently missing from release level 2: some astronomy and chemistry files (about 60 files)
- Currently missing from release level 3: some economics and history files (about 5 files)

2.
This code is currently unrelated to JScience OFFICIAL that is distributed at www.jscience.org: we expect to merge some day but we currently offer a separate developement trunk with many more features but much less support.

3.

1. FEATURES:

This is a general scientific library in Java. Is is as complete in each area as it can be although we have made every effort to keep it simple and easy to use. This is therefore a kind of survival kit or a portable lab.

Our coding standards are namely:
- Object Oriented: Objects/Interfaces are first class citizens (no utility methods)
- Generic (no primitive types, interfaces instead)
- Simple (even for the profane)
- Useful Classes exist for a purpose
- Easy to use
- Standards oriented
- XML oriented
- Documented

Why using JScience and not another package ? Well, JScience is a collective effort which has the aim to be maintained and enhanced over the time. JScience is also quite useful because you can submit your subpackages for addition into the framework for the benefits of everyone. Finally we make a lot of effort to always provide the fastest algorithms in a strong architecture, something that is quite difficult to achieve, especially for specialized packages.

This is an API, not an application per se. Mostly, it is an API to develop some others API or some applications. We therefore expect a different target audience than the mainstream internet user. In fact we target well defined sub groups:
- API builders to design APIs on top of this one
- Corporate developers looking for a wide spectrum free API
- Applet/Webstart developers that need to quick develop a product
- Researchers and graduate students that want to test something and (may be) don't require to build a full application

JScience, and especially the numerical intensive packages (mostly mathematics), uses two models. The first one is the traditional way in which scientific libraries are designed, is optimized for speed and relies heavily on ints and doubles, while offering a strong logic. The other one provides an even better model closer to theoritical concepts generally acknowledged in science. It is based on ExactIntegers and ExactReals which both provide infinite precision support at the sacrifice of some speed. It comes along with unit systems and quantities. It is much less developed in the current release than the traditional model mostly for the reason that it makes this API bigger and more complex while probably required by less users. There are some bridges that help switch from one model from another so you shouldn't have much difficulites using any of the two. Classes normally behave the same way in both models and mostly only differ by their names.

If you want to have an overview about how the packages are organized (object oriented and encapsulation), look at the org.jscience.sociology.Person class. Person extends Human which itself extends HistoricalIndividual which itself extends Individual, itself basically a Set Of Organs, itself a Set of Tissues, itself a Set of Cells which contain DNA or RNA. These are big Molecules made up of Atoms moving as physical Particles. Many other classes are used in the same way.


The library supports almost everything you should expect (except Education, see section 11 for solutions). It covers the following fields:
Architecture
Arts
Astronomy
Bibliography
Biology
Chemistry
Computing
Earth Sciences
Economics
Engineering
Geography
History
Law
Linguistics
Mathematics (which accounts for 20 percent of the classes, no more no less)
Measure (a general purpose measure scheme)
Medicine
Philosophy
Physics
Politics
Psychology
Sociology
Sports

And several devices, media filters, utils and widgets (beans).

There are also some XML parsers, namely MathML, OpenMath, CML, ObervationManager, SBML, gedcom, GML, TigerXML.

Some limitations are to be mentionned, see todo.txt for a complete explanation.

Finally there are many data files that are cobundled along with the classes. They are support information, NOT necessarily used by classes but brought to you so that you can have a handy reliable source of data.

Although we have made many efforts to produce such a library there is still room for a lot of improvements. Please report any inaccuray, bug, feature request through the JScience website http://www.jscience.org/.


2. INSTALLATION FOR END USERS:

Apart from Java itself, the distribution contains all the required files to be ready to run.

Install Java (1.5 or later) from http://www.java.com/. All class files are Java VM 1.5 compatible (as far as we know) although most of the packages should compile with Java 1.3 if needed (notable exception: org.jscience.measure). See also the "Required libraries" section below.

a. Unzip the current version of jscience.zip.

b. either:
Put the JScience library in the <jre>/lib/ext directory of your Java installation, removing all previous Jscience files.
Also include all the files in jscience/lib/ in the <jre>/lib/ext directory of your Java installation.
Note that you may write over existing files (which are probably older versions of the same libraries).
Or:
Remove any previous version of JScience by simply deleting the org.jscience directory.
Make sure your CLASSPATH environment variable contains a path to jscience/classes/jscience.jar.
Make sure your CLASSPATH environment variable contains a path to jscience/lib/ (the packages needed by JScience to run).

Run any sample with the command line, as usual.


3. COMPILATION AND JAVADOC FOR DEVELOPERS:

To compile all the code:
Install Java (1.5 or later) from http://www.java.com/. All class files are Java VM 1.5 compatible although most of the packages should compile with Java 1.3 if needed (notable exception: org.jscience.measure). The text encoding for the compiler must be UTF-8 (mainly for some Measure package classes) except for the org.jscience.computing.game package (which should be set as default encoding) and org.jscience.mathematics.geometry (cp1252). See also the "Required libraries" section below. Compile with the command line, as usual or with Ant (http://ant.apache.org/) using the supplied build.xml in the org package.

Javadoc shouldn't be generated for some classes in org.jscience.geography.coordinates, org.jscience.mathematics.algebraic.numbers, org.jscience.mathematics.geometry and org.jscience.physics.solids see the readme.txt in the corresponding package, as these classes are not part of the API.


4. REQUIRED LIBRARIES:

To compile and/or run all the classes in this library you will also need several libraries (list below). These libraries have been included in the lib directory so that you just need to drag and drop them to you Java /lib/ext folder.

J2EE (j2ee.jar) for the org.jscience.sociology.forms package. J2EE can be found at http://java.sun.com/javaee/index.jsp
Java3D for the org.jscience.astronomy package (among others). Java3D can be found at http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/3D/index.jsp.
JavaComm for the control of the LX200 or NexStar telescope (org.jscience.devices package). JavaComm can be found at http://java.sun.com/products/javacomm/index.jsp.
JavaMail for the notification mailer (org.jscience.net.progress). JavaMail can be found at http://java.sun.com/products/javamail/index.jsp (it is also included in the J2EE jar file). JavaMail is itself dependent upon JAF (Java Activation Framework) that can be found at http://java.sun.com/products/javabeans/jaf/.
OpenBQS client (BQS_ws.jar) for org.jscience.bibliography package found at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~senger/openbqs/
JGraph for the org.jscience.computing.graph package at http://www.jgraph.com/
AntLR for the org.jscience.computing.ai.planning package at http://www.antlr.org/
Javolution for the org.jscience.measure package at http://www.javolution.org/
The XML parsers (org.jscience.ml subpackages) require several XML libraries:
Xerces XML parser found at http://xml.apache.org/xerces2-j/
JDom XML parser found at http://www.jdom.org/
JAXEN XML parser found at http://www.jaxen.org/

Remember that you only need these libraries if you use the corresponding package or plan to recompile everything.

Optional libraries:
tools.jar (JDK doclet system) from the JDK lib directory must be in the classpath to compile the org.jscience.help.doclet subpackage. Warning, only version 1.5 of the tool.jar library (distributed with Java JDK 1.5) is supported, it won't compile with previous versions. This package is mostly needed if you want to recompile JScience and of no use as a developer.
JUnit for org.jscience.test subpackage found at http://www.junit.org/index.htm. This package is needed only if you want to test JScience and of no use as a developer.
Ant build tool to automate compilation found at http://ant.apache.org/

All these are also bundled in the lib directory along with the source code of JScience.

Note about the MathML 2.0, 2nd edition implementation and dtd:
The MathML (partial) implementation that can be found on the Jscience website is different from the standard implementation of the MathML dtd (http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/java/classes/org/w3c/dom/mathml/) and corrects minor bugs. Please download the version from jscience named MathML DOM. You will find the MathML dtd at http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/REC-MathML2-20031021/

5. EXTRA WARNINGS:

Though we made every possible effort to produce something that really rocks, we make no warranty of any sort about the results produced by using this library or whatsoever. You may actually loose zillions, crash your probe on Mars using the library which is provided as such and that you use at your own risk.

This is a scientific package. Futures release may NOT be compatible with the current code from the library. This means that code may NOT be upward compatible. One reason is that science changes from time to time and perhaps contradicts itself, wich means that we may have to rewrite the code because "it is not scientific anymore". However, we will make every effort so that there is very few effort on your side to update your code to a new version. Our philosophy is to produce a new version to provide more features, more precision, more efficiency, less bugs.

The library comes with several viewers that are currently designed by third parties and are merely cobundled and not fully integrated. You should consider these viewers as deprecated, although they are not marked as such.
This includes: org.jscience.astronomy.ephemeris, org.jscience.astronomy.milkyway, org.jscience.astronomy.solarsystem.constellations (as well as the factories for Comets, Asteroids and Artificial Satellites), org.jscience.chemistry.viewer (and subpackages), org.jscience.earth.weather.cityforecast and org.jscience.earth.weather.metar.

This is quite a large library. It is therefore full of errors, inconsistencies and innacuracies. Yelling is not the solution. Please, fill a request for enhancement, a bug report or drop us a mail for every missing contribution, copyright infringment or the like. We are working hard to make this library as good as possible and will make every effort to provide a rapid answer.

8. JSCIENCE MARKET SHARE:

After a couple of years browsing the Web for Java code, and after reviewing thousands of packages and applets, I have looked at about everything that exist in Java about science, robots and 3D. From this work I can make a few comments and draw a picture of the Java world. Also looking at the global community I can make a couple of comments about the share of the Java code in the scientific software market.

First, it must be said that there is a lot of Java code as scientific projects, either as full libraries or short snippets. The opportunity applets offer for visual demonstrations is really a very important language design choice, but also Java appears to be interesting because it is a nice language to learn and test on which you are rapidly productive. This is appealing for scientists. But Java is also chosen for more mature projects: object oriented features, multi platform and ease of networking to a lesser extent are good reasons to go for a development. Finally, the plug and play concept of API makes code sharing very fruitful.

As we find more and more Java projects, we move away from Fortran code which was widely accepted for high end scientific computation before. Actually, the only viable competitor to Java today is C (and C++). From my personal experience I would say there is about one third of projects in Java and the other two third in C (this does not take into account commercial products which are all designed in C). But Java code quality is often awesome and there is much less people spending there time in developing code that has been developed elsewhere. So, overall Java is probably on par or beats C. Also, there is virtually no C#, and I think this is really good for everyone.

Java is not seen anymore as a slow system and computation intensive tasks are also programmed in Java. C, however, is largely favored for such tasks. Java has only one drawback, it is designed by a commercial company and not an international standard like C. Actually, I would even say that Java is in its golden age but will probably leave it once for all in a couple of years.

Who is using scientific computation ?

We have the following categories of scientific software products available:
- applet demos and hands on
- one time models for scientific publication
- university API and opensource community projects
- high end all language systems, mostly parallel, closed and governmental
- windows all purpose mathematics applications
- stand alone commercial tailored solutions with proprietary model

Applets and one time models are usually designed in universities, by young enthusiasts (or sometimes Java addicts). They are normally short pieces of code that the author drops there without a chance for reuse or improvement. Sometimes the one and only algorithm is reused in bigger projects, in the same or a different language. This is either a university API or a governmental closed project. Universities prefer Java while government agencies prefer C because a good engineer is less expensive than a supercomputer. They also are dependent on tradition, power and habits. It is in this kind of projects that we find some Fortran code. As their projects are very big, there are always some spin off libraries developed that compete with stand alone API efforts made by universities. But comparison shows that Java products offer more features, are better maintained and supported by the whole free software community.

Finally, there is a really different range of scientific product, namely industrial products. These are sold, offering proprietary models, source code is unavailable, API and extensions are rather poor. The user is therefore the "final" user. These products are side by side to the opensource Java API. Researchers routinely use both while people in the industry only use these close products. The reason is that researchers need to achieve some (one time) results whereas industrials are part of a work flow with furnishers and clients (ie: they are specialists that process data in a standard repeatable manner). Closed products are almost all written in C and have features that no API will ever compete with. They make few use of (possibly underlying) libraries but widgets. They come in two flavors: wide spectrum all purpose products like Mathematica, Mapple, Gauss and task specific for example crystallography software. The later class is often sold with a physical device used for data acquisition.

So, what is JScience for ?

JScience is a kind of Wikipedia for scientific software. It is less detailed than a book that would cover a specific area although, on the other hand it provides general guidelines and ideas about how things goes. Developers are welcomed to subclass the existing packages and provide some detailed implementation in an domain with the benefit of having some others developers doing the same in other domains. They also are guarantied of having standard code, tested and optimized algorithms for the well known scientific concepts taught at undergraduate level.

This should bring in some more researchers and universities projects on a short time scale. This won't hurt much industrial C coded applications but may be push the market a bit towards more inter operability between their closed models.

With computer evolving according to Moore law, scientific computation has a bright future. There is a need for a standard base of code no one can afford to develop anymore while testing more complex models.


9. RELEASE HISTORY:

In November 2003, I (Silvere Martin-Michiellot) was looking for a general Newton kinematics model for the Digital Biosphere project (a 3D realtime simulation of the earth for augmented reality, www.digitalbiosphere.org) when I found JSci (jsci.sourceforge.net) as a general purpose scientific API. Yet it provided only scientific support in mathematics, some physics and chemistry as well as some AWT and Swing components. I started to write new modules for JSci that could latter be used by Digital Biosphere rather than hacking them directly. As it turned out, Mark Hale, the JSci leader never accepted me fully as a developer of new packages which he always refused to commit to cvs. I wasn't so much bothered though, since I had my own projects and hoped to release my code elsewhere if needed.

By April 2004 I had been working about 80 hours a week on this and contacted tens of people who had realtime datasources or scientific projects I could repackage. One of these was Jean-Marie Dautelle, the author of JADE, that had a very nice Units package and was a competitor for the Mathematics package. From April until August I kept working on the project but at a very low pace. By that time, Jean-Marie couldn't keep the name JADE for his project for silly copyright issues. I offered him to merge our works into a new project we named JScience. He managed to build up the website, register on dev.java.net and moved his original mature working code for release while I started working on the "experimental release", a merger of JSci, JADE and my code along with more and more packages up to cover the scientific knowledge up to undergraduate degree in every area.

Once again, from August 2004 to end 2005, I worked on week ends and late nights (although at a reasonable rate of about 20 hours a week), tried out hundereds of Java packages (actually almost every existing Java package) and contacted hundreds of people. From 2006 until now, I worked at a much lower pace as I found a job.

The result of all this is something that is about 4400 classes and 40 MB when zip-distributed with data files. This is the widest, most accurate and easiest scientific API ever. Many thanks to all countless contributors. Much remains to be done, actually there is work to improve every package for years.

Actually, after a second thought, I dreamt of having such a general science package about 20 years ago. Although, by that time there was no Java, and in fact no object language at all (apart from some lab tools). I am therefore especially happy of participating in such a project... and sad at the same time that noone tried hard enough before.

June/July 2008, first expected complete beta release.
