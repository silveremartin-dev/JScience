  Elder> used to say this, 'Mark became Peter's interpreter & wrote
  accurately all that he remembered, not, indeed, in order, of the things said
  or done by the Lord. For he had not heard the Lord, nor had he followed him,
  but later on, as I said, followed Peter, who used to give teaching as
  necessity demanded but not making, as it were, an arrangement of the Lord's
  oracles, so that Mark did nothing wrong in thus writing down single points
  as he remembered them. For to one thing he gave attention, to leave out
  nothing of what he had heard & to make no false statements in them.' This
  is related by Papias about Mark, & about Matthew this was said, 'Matthew
  collected the oracles in the Hebrew language <Aramaic>, & each interpreted
  them as best he could.'"[EH3.39.14-16(Loeb)]; Eusebius' NT Canon [EH3.3,25]:

  they excused themselves, saying, 'This age of lawlessness & unbelief is
  under Satan, who does not allow the truth & power of God to pervail over the
  unclean things of the spirits [or does not allow what lies under the unclean
  spirits to understand the truth & power of God]. Therefore reveal thy right-
  eousness now' - thus they spoke to Christ. & Christ replied to them, 'The
  term of years of Satan's power has been fulfilled, but other terrible things
  draw near. & for those who have sinned I was delivered over to death, that
  they many inherit the spirtual & incorruptible glory of righteousness which
  is in heaven.'" [A Textual Commentary on the Greek NT, Bruce Metzger, p.124]
