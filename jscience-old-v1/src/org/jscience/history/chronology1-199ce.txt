  "...Clement's Bible is the Old Testament, to which he refers repeatedly as
  Scripture (graphe), quoting it with more or less exactness. Clement also
  makes occasional reference to certain words of Jesus; though they are
  authoritative for him, he does not appear to enquire how their authenticity
  is ensured. In two of the three instances that he speaks of remembering 'the
  words' of Christ or of the Lord Jesus, it seems that he has a written record
  in mind, but he does not call it a 'gospel'. He knows several of Paul's
  epistles, and values them highly for their content; the same can be said of
  the Epistle to the Hebrews, with which he is well acquainted. Although these
  writings obviously possess for Clement considerable significance, he never
  refers to them as authoritative 'Scripture'." [Canon NT,Metzger,p.43]

  And he gained a following both among many Jews and among many of Greek ori-
  gin. And when Pilate, because of an accusation made by the leading men among
  us, condemned him to the cross, those who had loved him previously did not
  cease to do so. And up until this very day the tribe of Christians (named
  after him) has not died out." [JA18.3.3 Meier redaction, Marginal Jew, p.61]
