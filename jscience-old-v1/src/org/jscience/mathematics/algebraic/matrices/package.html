Although this package is already fairly complete, matrices are a big concern to many users,
especially because speed and memory storage is generally a real issue and we may save some
valuable computer resource by custom writting classes. If you therefore need classes that
are not already part of this package or extra methods, let us know.

Users of Colt (http://hoschek.home.cern.ch/hoschek/colt/index.htm) will be pleased to know we have
made efforts to provide an accurate, fast and very complete matrix package that should provide allmost
every feature exsting in the Colt package. Although we haven't yet made any deep benchmarking testing,
we are pretty confident that this package provides only a minimal speed loss used to provide a better
and easier model.
