This package and subpackage provides an easy way to manipulate symbolic expressions. It is unrelated to the analysis parent package although you can use it to define a RealFunction of some kind.


A comment from Axel

I've looked into the org.jscience.mathematics.analysis.expressions
package a bit.
Especially Addition and Multiplication are implemented as "binary
operators" which is very often not suitable in symbolic math. It's
better to think of math expressions having a "head" [1] and a "list"
of arguments (instead of a binary tree of arguments)
The head can have attributes [2] like Flat (for associative operators)
and Orderless (for commutative operators) to "normalize" the symbolic
math expression in a general "evaluation step".
The head doesn't need to be a "symbolic identifier" like Plus or
Minus, but can also be an arbritrary expression. This is often used
for "pure functions" (lambda calculus) [3].
An example is the Derivative Operator [4].
