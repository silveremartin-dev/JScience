/**
 * This class implements a Riemann integrator.
 * <p/>
 * <p>A Riemann integrator is a very simple one that assumes the
 * function is constant over the integration step. Since it is very
 * simple, this algorithm needs very small steps to achieve high
 * accuracy, and small steps lead to numerical errors and
 * instabilities.</p>
 * <p/>
 * <p>This algorithm is almost never used and has been included in
 * this package only as a simple template for more useful
 * integrators.</p>
