 * This class implements an enhanced Simpson-like integrator.

 * <p>A traditional Simpson integrator is based on a quadratic
 * approximation of the function on three equally spaced points. This
 * integrator does the same thing but can handle non-equally spaced
 * points. If it is used on a regular sample, it behaves exactly as a
 * traditional Simpson integrator.</p>
