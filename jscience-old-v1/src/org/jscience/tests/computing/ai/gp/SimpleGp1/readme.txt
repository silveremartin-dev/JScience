    This example contains a genetic program to find a boolean function which will
behave as the boolean 3-multiplexer function.

    The example is taken from the book written below:

- Koza J. R. Genetic Programming: On the Programming of Computers by Means of 
Natural Selection. Massachusetts: MIT Press, 1992, pp. 169-190.

    The Koza Tableau information for the genetic program is written below:


Objective                             - Find a boolean function which will behave
                                        as 3-multiplexer function
Terminal set                          - A0, D0, D1
Function set                          - And, Or, Not
Population size                       - 100
Crossover probability                 - 0.8
Mutation probability                  - 0.2
Selection method                      - Tournament
Termination criterion                 - none
Maximum number of generations         - 50
Maximum depth of tree after crossover - 20
Maximum mutant depth                  - 4
Initialization method                 - Grow
