org.jscience.geography.coordinates is based on SEDRIS Java SDK4.0 found at http://www.sedris.org/


For users familiar with geoTransform:

Anything you can do with Geotransform 1.5 is defined and ready to use in org.jscience.geography.coordinates.

Here's the obvious mappings:
Gcc_Coord_3D : Coord3D_Celestiocentric
Gdc_Coord_3D : Coord3D_Celestiodetic
Mercator_Coord_3D : Coord3D_Mercator
Utm_Coord_3D : Coord3D_Transverse_Mercator

Here's a questionable mapping:
Lambert_Coord_3D : Coord3D_LambertConformalConic

Here's a mapping that's not so obvious:
OSGB_Coord_3D : Coord3D_Transverse_Mercator (with ORM_OSGB_1936, and one of
the HSR_OSGBs)

Ellipsoids are encapsulated as "Object Reference Models" (ORMs) and are
given meaningful names instead of AA_Ellipsoid, etc.

Datums are encapsulated as HSRs (transforms from the Source to the
Reference frame).  These are also given meaningful names.

"Standard" SRFs are created with BaseSRF.createStandardSRF(CODE).
Things like UTM (with all the Zones) are organized into "SRF Sets" and
specific zones are instantiated with BaseSRF.createSRFSetMember(SET_CODE,
member,...)  Members 1-60 correspond to the 60 northern hemisphere zones,
61-120 correspond to the 60 southern hemisphere zones.

The coordinate conversion model has changed: the user is no longer
responsible for explicitly instantiating the appropriate conversion object.
Each coordinate's SRF is responsible for figuring out a conversion chain to
itself from whatever the source is.

Per using the docs, there's only one thing that Geotransform does
which the org.jscience.geography.coordinates package does not do:
the package is not optimized for conversions of
entire coordinate arrays.
