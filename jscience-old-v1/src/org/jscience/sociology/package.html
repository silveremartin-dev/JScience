This package is about society and sociology.

For sociology, also look into org.jscience.psychology.social, org.jscience.politics and org.jscience.economics. Sociology defines useful objects and data support for other packages.

Our society is very formalized (money, precise boundaries...) which is not the case for primitive society. I have usually provided a set of classes for primitive societies extended by another set of classes for modern societies.

I would have liked to provide a way not only to study human societies but also ants (or bees, etc) using the same set of classes. It appears there is really a much too big gap between humans and even other primates. Yet, ants have an economy, make war, have leaders and some social roles/groups. I have therefore used the most broad class as arguments when possible widening the context in which a concept/class can be understood.
