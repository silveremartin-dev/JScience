K-Means clustering.

//an interesting different package exist at http://www.sourcecodesworld.com/source/show.asp?ScriptID=807


Language, Platform and other Development Information
-----------------------------------------------------
Developed on Debian GNU/Linux using emacs, CVS, and Sun's JDK 1.4.

Compilation
-------------

A GNU Makefile is included to ease compilation.  Options are:

- make all      Basically runs javac *.java
- make clean    Cleans up
- make doc      Builds javadoc documentation from the code

If there is trouble building the swing-based files because of the version
of java, GUI components in the Makefile are grouped together to easily
disable building them.

Usage
-------------
After building, to run the program do:

java kmeans/KMeans [datafile] [maxclusters]

Where:
[datafile] - The filename of a file containing data.
[maxclusters] - An integer representing the maximum number of clusters.

Assumptions and Notes
----------------------
- I assume file format follows sample given on assignment page.


Special Features
---------------------
I created a GUI for helping myself visualize the data, which is
included.  It plots the data points, colors the clusters, and
shows the mean points.  To try it out, run:

java gui/DataSetView

The GUI assumes two dimensional data within a range of -20 and 20.

Classes and Functions
-----------------------

package KMeans:
- Coordinate class represents a single data point.  It has accessors
for its members, dimensionality.  It also has binary operators with
other Coordinates such as distance and addition.
- DataSet class is simply a collection of coordinates.  It can load them
from file, has accessors for operations such as number of samples
and dimensionality, and an iterator.
- Cluster is a subclass of DataSet.  It is also a collection of
coordinates, but it has the added ability to return the mean and
standard deviation of the coordinates it contains.  It can also find
calculate the likelihood a sample originated from that cluster.
- ClusterSet class is simply a container for a set of clusters.  It provides
accessors, iterators and meta-cluster operations such as likelihood
of an entire set of clusters.
- KMeans class implements the kmeans algorithm.  Given a DataSet
and a target number of clusters, it will iteratively break the
DataSet down into a set of clusters using the KMeans algorithm.

package GUI:
- Graph is a widget that displays a clusterset by coloring each
cluster a new color.  It assumes two dimensional data within a range
of 20 and -20.
- DataSetView is class implementing a swing GUI for opening files,
requesting colors, selecting options, etc.
