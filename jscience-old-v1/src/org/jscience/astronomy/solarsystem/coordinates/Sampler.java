    /** The Sampler class is the superset of classes
     *  that extract data at a given point given the data at other
     *  points.  Note that unlike the standard literature
     *  on sampling we deal with images whose boundaries are
     *  at integers, i.e., the first pixel includes the values 0 to 1.
     *  Thus when we resample it, we treat the value as having been
     *  measured at the mean value of the pixel, i.e., at 0.5.  For
     *  many samplers this means that we subtract 0.5 from the coordinates
     *  before we being sampling. This is in addition to the 0.5 offset
     *  between the pixel coordinates used here and the pixels defined in
     *  FITS files.  I.e., the center of the first pixel is 1 in FITS coordinates,
     *  0.5 in the coordinates used in most of the SkyView Java routines, and is
     *  most conveniently treated as 0 in resampling routines.
     *  <p>
     *  Many resamplers allow for optional parameters.  E.g., the Lanczos resampling
     *  can use any number of pixels.  To accommodate resamplers parametrized by
     *  a single integer value, e.g., the Lanczos and Spline resamplers, a
     *  setOrder method is provided.  For fixed resamplers, e.g., the Nearest Neighbor (NN),
     *  Linear Interpolation (LI) or Clipping (Clip) resamplers, this function has
     *  not effect.
     *  <p>
     *  All fields in this class are given protected access to allow direct
     *  use in sub-classes since this class often determines the
     *  total throughput of an operation.
