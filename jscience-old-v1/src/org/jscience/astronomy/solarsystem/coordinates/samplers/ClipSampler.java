/** 
 * The class implements a fast flux conserving resampling
 * based on the Sutherland-Hodgman clipping algorithm.
 * <p>
 * Consider an original image of data in some projection and
 * a new map of an overlapping region with some
 * projection, coordinate system, etc.  Assume that the flux
 * within a given pixel in the original image is constant
 * over the area of the pixel.
 * The flux within each pixel in the new map should be
 * the integral of the flux in the region occupied by
 * each pixel in the map.
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li> Find all of the corners of the pixels in resampled
 * map and project the positions of these corners into
 * the projection of the original image. These should
 * be scaled such that the coordinates run from 0 to inWidth and inHeight
 * where inWidth and inHeight are the dimensions of the original image.
 * I.e., in these coordinate each pixel in the original image
 * is a unit square.  This step is done prior to
 * call the primary ClipSampler methods in this class.  Note
 * that the corners of the pixels are required rather than
 * the pixel centers.
 * 
 * <li>For each pixel in the resampled map, find a bounding
 * box in the original image's coordinates.  This is used
 * to find a rectangle of candidate pixels in the original image that
 * may contribute flux to this pixel in the resampled map.
 * 
 * <li>For each candidate image pixel clip the resampled pixel
 * to the image pixels boundaries.
 * 
 * <li>Calculate the area of the clipped region.  This is easy since
 * the clipped region is a convex polygon and we have the vertices.
 * Triangulating the polygon allows us to calculate its area.
 * 
 * <li>Add a flux to the resampled pixel equal to the area of the
 * clipped resampled pixel times the flux in the original map pixel
 * 
 * <li> Repeat for all candidate original pixels
 * 
 * <li> Go to the next resampling pixel.
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The instance methods of this class are not thread-safe, however
 * it is possible to generate a separate ClipSampler object for
 * each thread to resample the same input image.
