TIGER API 1.8 - A Java interface to the TIGER corpus - front end classes.

<p>TIGER API is a library which allows Java programmers to easily access
    the structure of any corpus given as a
    <a
            href="http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/projekte/TIGER/TIGERSearch/doc/html/TigerXML.html"
            >TIGER-XML</a> file.
    The underlying API specifies a Java object model for corpora encoded in
    TIGER-XML and provides methods for traversing syntax trees and accessing
    elements such as sentences, syntax graph nodes, and their attributes.</p>

<p>The provided parser processes a given TIGER-XML file, builds data
    structures representing the corpus and renders a Java <tt>Corpus</tt>
    object. This <tt>Corpus</tt> object represents the given corpus and its
    structures and serves as an entry point for accessing its syntax trees,
    its nodes and their attributes.</p>

<p>The library further provides a set of tools for processing the
    given corpus, which covers common tasks such as extracting text strings,
    retrieving index features of phrases and terminals, generating graphical
    ASCII representations of the trees, determining tree structural relations
    between nodes and other tasks of syntactic processing.</p>

<p>The API can also be used for converting TIGER-XML encoded corpora to other
    formats; a sample converter is included.
    In order to access other corpus formats than TIGER-XML the TIGERRegistry
    (included in
    <a HREF="http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/projekte/TIGER/TIGERSearch/"
            >TIGERSearch</a>) can be used to convert them into the TIGER-XML format.</p>

<p>The API usage is easy and intuitive: no manual processing of XML
    is required. The TIGER API completely abstracts the corpus object model
    from its XML representation.</p>

<b>Sample Usage</b>

<p>
    <code><pre>
import java.util.*;

import org.jscience.ml.tigerxml.*;

public class TestTigerAPI {

  public static void main(String[] args) {

    // Create a Corpus object by parsing the given xml file
    Corpus corpus = new Corpus("sample_TIGER.xml");

    // Use the corpus object to print parts of the structure
    System.out.println("Corpus.getId: " + corpus.getId());

    // All-sentences-loop
    for (int i = 0; i < corpus.getSentenceCount(); i++) {
      Sentence sent = corpus.getSentence(i);
      System.out.println("Sentence ID: " + sent.getId());
      System.out.println("NonTerminals: ");

      // All-NTs-loop
      for (int j = 0; j < sent.getNTCount(); j++) {
        NT nt = sent.getNT(j);
        System.out.println("NT ID: " + nt.getId());
        System.out.println("   CAT: " + nt.getCat());
        System.out.println("   MOTHER: " + nt.getMother());
        System.out.println("   Edge2Mother: " + nt.getEdge2Mother());
      } // for j
    } // for i
  } // main
} // class
</pre>
    </code>
