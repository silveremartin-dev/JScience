Databases we support (these are meant to be the most inclusives databases):

http://www.cbif.gc.ca/pls/itisca/ (ITIS*ca database of taxonomic nomenclature)


About the Itis database:
This interface includes the ability to search the
<a href="http://www.cbif.gc.ca/pls/itisca/">ITIS*ca database</a>
for a string match to a taxon name, which
returns the ITIS Taxonomic Serial Number (TSN) for that taxon.  One can
then use the TSN to query ITIS*ca and find the scientific name,
rank, author, synonym taxa, parent taxa, and children taxa
(e.g., species within a genus), among other information. The "Itis" class
is the main entry point for programmers to utilize the interface. All
communication with the ITIS*ca database is accomplished using HTTP
requests and XML formatted responses.
See ITIS*ca for details on
the ITIS database.

Technical Details of tree of life xml file:

The structure of the tree is contained in a single XML element, the
<TREE> element. The
    <TREE> element contains a single element,
        <NODES>, which contains zero or more
            <NODE> elements. This pattern repeats itself out to the tips of the current tree structure of the ToL
                Project. Note that the current tree structure is by no means complete, but in some branches it does
                reach out to the actual leaves of the tree (this is denoted by a special LEAF attribute on NODE
                elements).


                NODE Attributes Summary
                HASPAGE 1 - the node has a page on the Tree of Life Web Project
                0 - it doesn't

                ID The unique identifier for that node on the Tree of Life Web Project
                EXTINCT 0 - node is not extinct
                2 - node is extinct

                CONFIDENCE Confidence of placement in the tree structure:
                0 - confident
                1 - incertae sedis putative position
                2 - incertae sedis position unspecified

                PHYLESIS 0 - monophyletic
                1 - monophyly uncertain
                2 - not monophyletic

                CHILDCOUNT the number of children in the Tree of Life Web Project for a given node
                LEAF 1 - the node represents a leaf in the Tree of Life
                0 - the node does not represent a leaf


                NODE Elements Summary
                NAME The official name for the node in the Tree of Life Web Project
                NODES Children nodes for this node
