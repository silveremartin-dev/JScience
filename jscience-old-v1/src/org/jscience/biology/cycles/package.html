This subpackage contains only the basic features of the cycles as complete balanced equations would
require the description of at least 20 molecules and tens of chemical reactions.

We will be glad to add this work here should you wish to build these reactions up.

//Metabolism has changed a great deal as life on earth has
//evolved. This has been particularly true of the reactions organisms
//use to capture energy from the sun to build organic
//molecules (anabolism), and then break down organic
//molecules to obtain energy (catabolism). These processes,
//the subject of the next two chapters, evolved in concert
//with each other.

//Degradation
//The most primitive forms of life are thought to have obtained
//chemical energy by degrading, or breaking down,
//organic molecules that were abiotically produced.
//The first major event in the evolution of metabolism was
//the origin of the ability to harness chemical bond energy.
//At an early stage, organisms began to store this energy in
//the bonds of ATP, an energy carrier used by all organisms
//today.

//Glycolysis
//The second major event in the evolution of metabolism
//was glycolysis, the initial breakdown of glucose. As proteins
//evolved diverse catalytic functions, it became possible to
//capture a larger fraction of the chemical bond energy in organic
//molecules by breaking chemical bonds in a series of
//steps. For example, the progressive breakdown of the sixcarbon
//sugar glucose into three-carbon molecules is performed
//in a series of 10 steps that results in the net production
//of two ATP molecules. The energy for the synthesis of
//ATP is obtained by breaking chemical bonds and forming
//new ones with less bond energy, the energy difference
//being channeled into ATP production. This biochemical
//pathway is called glycolysis.
//Glycolysis undoubtedly evolved early in the history of life
//on earth, since this biochemical pathway has been retained
//by all living organisms. It is a chemical process that does not
//appear to have changed for well over 3 billion years.

//Anaerobic Photosynthesis
//The third major event in the evolution of metabolism was
//anaerobic photosynthesis. Early in the history of life, some
//organisms evolved a different way of generating ATP,
//called photosynthesis. Instead of obtaining energy for ATP
//synthesis by reshuffling chemical bonds, as in glycolysis,
//these organisms developed the ability to use light to pump
//protons out of their cells, and to use the resulting proton
//gradient to power the production of ATP, a process called
//chemiosmosis.
//Photosynthesis evolved in the absence of oxygen and
//works well without it. Dissolved H2S, present in the oceans
//beneath an atmosphere free of oxygen gas, served as a ready
//source of hydrogen atoms for building organic molecules.
//Free sulfur was produced as a by-product of this reaction.

//Nitrogen Fixation
//Nitrogen fixation was the fourth major step in the evolution
//of metabolism. Proteins and nucleic acids cannot be
//synthesized from the products of photosynthesis because
//both of these biologically critical molecules contain nitrogen.
//Obtaining nitrogen atoms from N2 gas, a process
//called nitrogen fixation, requires the breaking of an N to N
//triple bond. This important reaction evolved in the
//hydrogen-rich atmosphere of the early earth, an atmosphere
//in which no oxygen was present. Oxygen acts as a
//poison to nitrogen fixation, which today occurs only in
//oxygen-free environments, or in oxygen-free compartments
//within certain bacteria.

//Oxygen-Forming Photosynthesis
//The substitution of H2O for H2S in photosynthesis was the
//fifth major event in the history of metabolism. Oxygenforming
//photosynthesis employs H2O rather than H2S as a
//source of hydrogen atoms and their associated electrons.
//Because it garners its hydrogen atoms from reduced oxygen
//rather than from reduced sulfur, it generates oxygen gas
//rather than free sulfur.
//More than 2 billion years ago, small cells capable of carrying
//out this oxygen-forming photosynthesis, such as
//cyanobacteria, became the dominant forms of life on earth.
//Oxygen gas began to accumulate in the atmosphere. This
//was the beginning of a great transition that changed conditions
//on earth permanently. Our atmosphere is now 20.9%
//oxygen, every molecule of which is derived from an
//oxygen-forming photosynthetic reaction.

//Aerobic Respiration
//Aerobic respiration is the sixth and final event in the history
//of metabolism. This cellular process harvests energy
//by stripping energetic electrons from organic molecules.
//Aerobic respiration employs the same kind of proton
//pumps as photosynthesis, and is thought to have evolved as
//a modification of the basic photosynthetic machinery.
//However, the hydrogens and their associated electrons are
//not obtained from H2S or H2O, as in photosynthesis, but
//rather from the breakdown of organic molecules.
//Biologists think that the ability to carry out photosynthesis
//without H2S first evolved among purple nonsulfur
//bacteria, which obtain their hydrogens from organic compounds
//instead. It was perhaps inevitable that among the
//descendants of these respiring photosynthetic bacteria,
//some would eventually do without photosynthesis entirely,
//subsisting only on the energy and hydrogens derived
//from the breakdown of organic molecules. The mitochondria
//within all eukaryotic cells are thought to be
//their descendants.

Aerobic organism
An aerobic organism or aerobe is an organism that has an oxygen based metabolism. Aerobes, in a process known as cellular respiration, use oxygen to oxidize substrates (for example sugars and fats) in order to obtain energy.
A good example would be the oxidation of glucose (a monosaccharide) in aerobic respiration.
C6H12O6 + 6 O2 + 38 ADP + 38 phosphate ? 6 CO2 + 6 H2O + 38 ATP
The energy released in this equation is about 2880 kJ per mol, which is conserved in regenerating 38 ATP from 38 ADP per glucose. This is a factor of 19 times more energy per sugar molecule than the typical anaerobic reaction generates.
Notice that oxygen is used during the oxidation of glucose and water is produced.
This equation is a summary of what actually happens in three series of biochemical reactions: glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation.
We distinguish between obligate aerobes and facultative aerobes: obligate aerobes require oxygen, while facultative aerobes can use oxygen, but also have other options, such as nitrogen. Microaerophiles are organisms that may use oxygen, but only at low concentration. Aerotolerant organisms can survive in the presence of oxygen, but they are anaerobic because they cannot use it.
Almost all animals, most fungi and several bacteria are obligate aerobes. Most anaerobic organisms are bacteria. Being an obligate aerobe, although being advantageous from the energetical point of view, means also obligatory facing high levels of oxidative stress.
Yeast is an example of a facultative aerobe. Individual human cells are also facultative aerobes: they switch to lactic acid fermentation if oxygen is not available. However, for the whole organism this cannot be sustained for long, and humans are therefore obligate aerobes.

Anaerobic organism
An anaerobic organism or anaerobe is any organism that does not require oxygen for growth. Obligate anaerobes will die when exposed to atmospheric levels of oxygen, while facultative anaerobes can use oxygen when it is present. Aerotolerant organisms do not require oxygen, but are not affected by exposure to air. Microaerophiles are organisms that may use oxygen, but only at low concentrations (low micromolar range); their growth is inhibited by normal oxygen concentrations (approximately 200 micromolar). Nanaerobes are organisms that cannot grow in the presence of micromolar concentrations of oxygen, but can grow with and benefit from nanomolar concentrations of oxygen.
Obligate anaerobes may use fermentation or anaerobic respiration. In the presence of oxygen, facultative anaerobes use aerobic respiration; without oxygen some of them ferment, some use anaerobic respiration. Aerotolerant organisms are strictly fermentative. Microaerophiles carry out aerobic respiration, and some of then can also do anaerobic respiration.
There are many chemical equations for anaerobic fermentative reactions.
Fermentative anaerobic organisms mostly use the lactic acid fermentation pathway:
C6H1206 + 2 ADP + 2 phosphate ? 2 lactic acid + 2 ATP
The energy released in this equation is approximately 150 kJ per mol, which is conserved in regenerating two ATP from ADP per glucose. This is only 5% of the energy per sugar molecule than the typical aerobic reaction generates.
Plants and fungi (e.g., yeasts) generally use alcohol (ethanol) fermentation when oxygen becomes limiting:
C6H1206 + 2 ADP + 2 phosphate ? 2 C2H5OH + 2 CO2 + 2 ATP
The energy released is about 180 kJ per mol, which is conserved in regenerating two ATP from ADP per glucose.
Anaerobic bacteria and archaea use these and many other fermentative pathways, e.g., propionic acid fermentation, butyric acid fermentation, solvent fermentation, mixed acid fermentation, butanediol fermentation, Stickland fermentation, acetogenesis or methanogenesis.
Some anaerobic bacteria produce toxins (e.g., tetanus or botulinum toxins) that are highly dangerous to higher organisms, including humans.
