<P><A NAME="1 features"></A>1. FEATURES:</P>
<P>This is a general scientific library in Java. Is is as complete in
each area as it can be although we have made every effort to keep it
simple and easy to use. This is therefore a kind of survival kit or a
portable lab.</P>
<P>Our coding standards are namely:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Object Oriented: Objects/Interfaces are first class citizens
	(no utility methods)</P>
	<LI><P>Generic (no primitive types, interfaces instead)</P>
	<LI><P>Simple (even for the profane)</P>
	<LI><P>Useful Classes exist for a purpose</P>
	<LI><P>Easy to use</P>
	<LI><P>Standards oriented</P>
	<LI><P>XML oriented</P>
	<LI><P>Documented</P>
</UL>
<P>This is an API, not an application per se. Mostly, it is an API to
develop some others API or some applications. We therefore expect a
different target audience than the mainstream Internet user. In fact
we target well defined sub groups:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>API builders to design APIs on top of this one</P>
	<LI><P>Corporate developers looking for a wide spectrum free API</P>
	<LI><P>Applet/Webstart developers that need to quick develop a
	product</P>
	<LI><P>Researchers and graduate students that want to test something
	and (may be) don't require to build a full application</P>
</UL>
<P>JScience, and especially the numerical intensive packages (mostly
mathematics), uses two models. The first one is the traditional way
in which scientific libraries are designed, is optimized for speed
and relies heavily on ints and doubles, while offering a strong
logic. The other one provides an even better model closer to
theoritical concepts generally acknowledge in science. It is based on
ExactIntegers and ExactReal which both provide infinite precision
support at the sacrifice of some speed. It comes along with unit
systems and quantities. It is much less developed in the current
release than the traditional model mostly for the reason that it
makes this API bigger and more complex while probably required by
less users. There are some bridges that help switch from one model
from another so you shouldn't have much difficulties using any of the
two. Classes normally behave the same way in both models and mostly
only differ by their names.</P>
<P>If you want to have an overview about how the packages are
organized (object oriented and encapsulation), look at the
org.jscience.sociology.Person class. Person extends
HistoricalIndividual which itself extends Individual, itself
basically a Set Of Organs, itself a Set of Tissues, itself a Set of
Cells which contain DNA or RNA. These are big Molecules made up of
Atoms moving as physical Particles. Many other classes are used in
the same way.</P>
<P>The library supports almost everything you should expect. It
covers the following fields:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Astronomy</P>
	<LI><P>Bibliography</P>
	<LI><P>Biology</P>
	<LI><P>Chemistry</P>
	<LI><P>Computing</P>
	<LI><P>Earth</P>
	<LI><P>Economics</P>
	<LI><P>Geography</P>
	<LI><P>History</P>
	<LI><P>Law</P>
	<LI><P>Linguistics</P>
	<LI><P>Mathematics</P>
	<LI><P>Medicine</P>
	<LI><P>Measure (a general purpose measure scheme)</P>
	<LI><P>Philosophy</P>
	<LI><P>Physics</P>
	<LI><P>Politics</P>
	<LI><P>Psychology</P>
	<LI><P>Society</P>
</UL>
<P>And several devices, media filters, utils and widgets.</P>
<P>There are also some XML parsers, namely MathML, OpenMath, CML,
SBML, gedcom, GML, HEML, TigerXML.</P>
<P>Some limitations are to be mentioned, see todo.txt for a complete
explanation.</P>
<P>Finally there are many data files that are co bundled along with
the classes. They are support information, NOT necessarily used by
classes but brought to you so that you can have a handy reliable
source of data.</P>
<P>Although we have made many efforts to produce such a library there
is still room for a lot of improvements. Please report any inaccuray,
bug, feature request through the JScience website
<A HREF="http://www.jscience.org/">http://www.jscience.org/</A>.</P>

<P><A NAME="5 warnings"></A>5. WARNINGS:</P>
<P>This is a scientific package. Futures release may NOT be
compatible with the current code from the library. This means that
code may NOT be upward compatible. One reason is that science changes
from time to time and perhaps contradicts itself, wich means that we
may have to rewrite the code because &quot;it is not scientific
anymore&quot;. However, we will make every effort so that there is
very few effort on your side to update your code to a new version.
Our philosophy is to produce a new version to provide more features,
more precision, more efficiency, less bugs.</P>
<P>The library comes with several viewers that are currently designed
by third parties and are merely co bundled and not fully integrated.
You should consider these viewers as deprecated, although they are
not marked as such.</P>
<P>This includes: org.jscience.astronomy.ephemeris,
org.jscience.astronomy.milkyway,
org.jscience.astronomy.solarsystem.constellations (as well as the
factories for Comets, Asteroids and Artificial Satellites),
org.jscience.chemistry.viewer (and subpackages),
org.jscience.earth.weather.cityforecast and
org.jscience.earth.weather.metar.</P>
<P>This is quite a large library. It is therefore full of errors,
inconsistencies and inaccuracies. Yelling is not the solution.
Please, fill a request for enhancement, a bug report or drop us a
mail for every missing contribution, copyright infringement or the
like. We are working hard to make this library as good as possible
and will make every effort to provide a rapid answer.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P><A NAME="6 contributions"></A>6. CONTRIBUTIONS:</P>
<P>We have asked and received permission to use all the code and
files we did not produce ourselves.</P>
<P>Though, we still are waiting an answer from Prentice Hall for the
org.jscience.media.audio.dsp package.</P>
<P>Safety signs pdf files taken from
<A HREF="http://www.urwpp.de/common/pdf/cd_l_safetysigns.pdf">http://www.urwpp.de/common/pdf/cd_l_safetysigns.pdf
</A>or <A HREF="http://www.mr-clipart.com/products/safety/safetysigns-e.html">http://www.mr-clipart.com/products/safety/safetysigns-e.html</A>.

(<A HREF="http://java.sun.com/developer/techDocs/hi/repository/">http://java.sun.com/developer/techDocs/hi/repository/</A>).</P>
<P>We also bundle many datafiles and physical measurements produced
by many sources. Some of these files were converted to xml or
reorganized by ourselves. You will normally find an accompanying
document (Java, html or text file) describing the original
location(s).</P>
<P>The Duke logo, is based on the Java Duke, copyrighted by Sun
Microsystems.</P>

<P><A NAME="8 JScience share"></A>8. JSCIENCE MARKET SHARE:</P>
<P>After a couple of years browsing the Web for Java code, and after
reviewing thousands of packages and applets, I have looked at about
everything that exist in Java about science, robots and 3D. From this
work I can make a few comments and draw a picture of the Java world.
Also looking at the global community I can make a couple of comments
about the share of the Java code in the scientific software market.</P>
<P>First, it must be said that there is a lot of Java code as
scientific projects, either as full libraries or short snippets. The
opportunity applets offer for visual demonstrations is really a very
important language design choice, but also Java appears to be
interesting because it is a nice language to learn and test on which
you are rapidly productive. This is appealing for scientists. But
Java is also chosen for more mature projects: object oriented
features, multi platform and ease of networking to a lesser extent
are good reasons to go for a development. Finally, the plug and play
concept of API makes code sharing very fruitful.</P>
<P>As we find more and more Java projects, we move away from Fortran
code which was widely accepted for high end scientific computation
before. Actually, the only viable competitor to Java today is C (and
C++). From my personal experience I would say there is about one
third of projects in Java and the other two third in C (this does not
take into account commercial products which are all designed in C).
But Java code quality is often awesome and there is much less people
spending there time in developing code that has been developed
elsewhere. So, overall Java is probably on par or beats C. Also,
there is virtually no C#, and I think this is really good for
everyone.</P>
<P>Java is not seen anymore as a slow system and computation
intensive tasks are also programmed in Java. C, however, is largely
favored for such tasks. Java has only one drawback, it is designed by
a commercial company and not an international standard like C.
Actually, I would even say that Java is in its golden age but will
probably leave it once for all in a couple of years.</P>
<P>Who is using scientific computation ?</P>
<P>We have the following categories of scientific software products
available:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>applet demos and hands on</P>
	<LI><P>one time models for scientific publication</P>
	<LI><P>university API and opensource community projects</P>
	<LI><P>high end all language systems, mostly parallel, closed and
	governmental</P>
	<LI><P>windows all purpose mathematics applications</P>
	<LI><P>stand alone commercial tailored solutions with proprietary
	model</P>
</UL>
<P>Applets and one time models are usually designed in universities,
by young enthusiasts (or sometimes Java addicts). They are normally
short pieces of code that the author drops there without a chance for
reuse or improvement. Sometimes the one and only algorithm is reused
in bigger projects, in the same or a different language. This is
either a university API or a governmental closed project.
Universities prefer Java while government agencies prefer C because a
good engineer is less expensive than a supercomputer. They also are
dependent on tradition, power and habits. It is in this kind of
projects that we find some Fortran code. As their projects are very
big, there are always some spin off libraries developed that compete
with stand alone API efforts made by universities. But comparison
shows that Java products offer more features, are better maintained
and supported by the whole free software community.</P>
<P>Finally, there is a really different range of scientific product,
namely industrial products. These are sold, offering proprietary
models, source code is unavailable, API and extensions are rather
poor. The user is therefore the &quot;final&quot; user. These
products are side by side to the opensource Java API. Researchers
routinely use both while people in the industry only use these close
products. The reason is that researchers need to achieve some (one
time) results whereas industrials are part of a work flow with
furnishers and clients (ie: they are specialists that process data in
a standard repeatable manner). Closed products are almost all written
in C and have features that no API will ever compete with. They make
few use of (possibly underlying) libraries but widgets. They come in
two flavors: wide spectrum all purpose products like Mathematica,
Mapple, Gauss and task specific for example crystallography software.
The later class is often sold with a physical device used for data
acquisition.</P>
<P>So, what is JScience for ?</P>
<P>JScience is a kind of Wikipedia for scientific software. It is
less detailed than a book that would cover a specific area although,
on the other hand it provides general guidelines and ideas about how
things goes. Developers are welcomed to subclass the existing
packages and provide some detailed implementation in an domain with
the benefit of having some others developers doing the same in other
domains. They also are guarantied of having standard code, tested and
optimized algorithms for the well known scientific concepts taught at
undergraduate level.</P>
<P>This should bring in some more researchers and universities
projects on a short time scale. This won't hurt much industrial C
coded applications but may be push the market a bit towards more
inter operability between their closed models.</P>
<P>With computer evolving according to Moore law, scientific
computation has a bright future. There is a need for a standard base
of code no one can afford to develop anymore while testing more
complex models.</P>

<P><A NAME="9 release history"></A>9. RELEASE HISTORY:</P>
<P>In November 2003, I (Silvere Martin-Michiellot) was looking for a
general Newton kinematics model for the Digital Biosphere project (a
3D realtime simulation of the earth for augmented reality,
www.digitalbiosphere.org) when I found JSci (jsci.sourceforge.net) as
a general purpose scientific API. Yet it provided only scientific
support in mathematics, some physics and chemistry as well as some
AWT and Swing components. I started to write new modules for JSci
that could latter be used by Digital Biosphere rather than hacking
them directly. As it turned out, Mark Hale, the JSci leader never
accepted me fully as a developer of new packages which he always
refused to commit to cvs. I wasn't so much bothered though, since I
had my own projects and hoped to release my code elsewhere if needed.
By April 2004 I had been working about 80 hours a week on this and
contacted tens of people who had realtime datasources or scientific
projects I could repackage. One of these was Jean-Marie Dautelle, the
author of JADE, that had a very nice Units package and a concurrent
Mathematics package. From April until August I kept working on the
project but at a very low pace. By that time, Jean-Marie couldn't
keep the name JADE for his project for silly copyright issues. I
offered him to merge our works into a new project we named JScience.
He managed to build up the website, register on dev.java.net and
moved his original mature working code for release while I started
working on the &quot;experimental release&quot;, a merger of JSci,
JADE and my code along with more and more packages up to cover the
scientific knowledge up to undergraduate degree in every area. Once
again, from August 2004 to mid 2005, I worked on week ends and late
nights (although at a reasonable rate of about 20 hours a week),
tried out hundered of Java packages (actually almost every existing
Java package), contacted hundreds of people to produce something that
is about 2500 classes and 17 MB when zip-distributed with data files.
This is neverthless the widest, most accurate and easiest scientific
API ever. Many thanks to all countless contributors. Much remains to
be done, actually there is work to improve every package for years.</P>
<P>Actually, after a second thought, I dreamt of having such a
general science package about 20 years ago. Although, by that time
there was no Java, and in fact no object language at all (apart from
some lab tools). I am therefore especially happy of participating in
such a project... and sad at the same time that noone tried hard
enough before.</P>
