About Italy:

Since December 1998, calls to land lines in the cities below and all other points in Italy
must include a leading "0" regardless of whether the call originates within or outside of Italy.
However, the leading "0" is not required with mobile phones.

In Italy, local area code is now required for all calls to local exchange area.

Additionally, further changes in the numbering plan are expected in 2002:

Land line phones will be prefixed by "4" 


About Spain:

Spain enacted a new dialing plan on 4 April 1998, prefixing all area codes with a "9."  
Currently, all numbers in Spain have nine digits and require the use of area codes.
This includes mobile phones.  No NDD (National Direct Dialing) number is needed.
