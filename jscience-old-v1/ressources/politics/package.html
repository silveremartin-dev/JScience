Maxmind, http://www.maxmind.com/, offers a free database that identifies the country based on the IP address.

http://www.maxmind.com/app/geoip_country (for the database)
http://www.maxmind.com/app/java (for the API)

This database is reproduced here in GeoIP.dat.

iptocountry.csv is another database with the same features taken at http://ip-to-country.webhosting.info/node/view/6


Another interesting database is available at

It contains the following fields for approximately 2,710,000 records:
