Why doesn't the packages make a direct use of the Units as defined in javax.units ?

Actually, this would imply much overhead for computation which really needs to be efficient.
We already use get() and set() methods instead of querying directly the fields which slows a bit the system.
This design however strongly enhance the system towards reliability and readability.
Units are to be found only at the input or output stage, that is, on the user side.
You convert the units using javax.units to internal units from user request, and convert back
to display the result of computation when the output value is computed.
The packages itself all rely on the SI (Syst�me International d'Unit�s) base units:
all values are computed in meters, seconds, kilos, amperes, candela, kelvin, moles, or their derived units, as expected.
