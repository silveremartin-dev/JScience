This package is a placeholder to mechanical and electrical, etc... ways of designing solutions to actual problems.
This is not really science but rather (applied) "practical science".

Perhaps this is really a bad idea to have a package with this name as with a bit of effort we should be able to move every subpackage to its appropriate corresponding scientific hierarchy. The org.jscience.engineering.control package for example could be moved to the org.jscience.computing.robotics.cybernetics
