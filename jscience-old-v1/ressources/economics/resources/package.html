This package builds up an ontology for things you can find in nature.
This should be material things, both natural and artifical.

This is an affordance based ontology in that objects come associated with the expected grounded knowledge one can expect from it, ie: they are described according and to be used with they common function.

Be aware there is some overlap with existing class (creature, solid, liquid, gas) in others packages.


Culture classification schemes, see: http://www.vterrain.org/Culture/culture_class.html
http://www.ontologyportal.org/ SUMO is especially to be considered.
http://www.sedris.org/edcs.htm is also interesting but without Java API.
