I expected to design an XML file of resources, tools and tasks as a LEGO kit to design complex items to account for primitive and modern craft making. But such lists don't exist on the web apart from cooking/recipies: "take the onions, slice them, fry them in oil for 5 minutes...". This is weird since it is not that difficult to build such lists (apart for some XXth century chemical processes for example). If you have some data on this, let us know.



Tasks (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy_of_manufacturing_processes, or this directory):
cut, lift, throw, break, cover, mix, heat, mould, move, nail...


Resources:
meat, vegetables, fruits, water, skin, bones, stones, sticks, fire, wood, earth, cattle, cotton, maize, oil, sand, copper, gold, silver, etc.
