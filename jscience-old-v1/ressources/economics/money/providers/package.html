Calling these classes will actually make network requests for real quotes.
It is your responsability to minimalize network access by caching fetched values.

On a separate track, don't expect any reliabilty on these classes as providers may change the system they use or even disappear.
You should use them as a source of ideas when implementing your own providers.
