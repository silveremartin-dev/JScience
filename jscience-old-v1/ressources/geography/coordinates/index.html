<p>I presume you are reading this document because you have some task before you which requires the use of
    coordinates. Whether you are setting up a simulation, trying to track satellites, or recording the location of
    tree plots, your real job is to accomplish the task at hand. Your job is not to invent, yet again, some means of
    keeping track of position.</p>

<p>This document exists to help you find what you need quickly. It is not a complete description of the underlying
    model. Hopefully, reading it will not prevent you from learning what you need to know in order to obtain
    accurate results. In places, it will strongly suggest that you take it upon yourself to learn more before
    proceeding. The effort you invest learning how coordinates work may very well pay off when you're debugging.</p>

            </div>
        </div>
        <div></div>
    </div>
    <p>JScience incorporates the <a href="http://www.sedris.org" target="_top"> SEDRIS Spatial Reference Model
        (SRM)</a>, a very powerful model which can do nearly anything one would like to do with coordinates. It
        automatically keeps track of the <span class="emphasis"><em>type</em></span> of coordinate and any extra
        data (parameterizations) which should accompany the coordinate. This enables the SRM to automatically
        perform conversions when you request it (or at least inform you when it does not know of a conversion).</p>

    <p>However, no system can produce accurate results if it is furnished incorrect or incomplete data. Every effort
        has been made within JScience to make common tasks easy to perform and easy to identify. But there comes a
        point where the only way to make things easier is for someone who does <span
            class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> have your data to make decisions they <span
            class="emphasis"><em>cannot</em></span>
        enforce about your data. This will almost certainly lead to a situation where the SRM is provided inaccurate
        information, which will yield incorrect results.</p>

    <p>The <a href="http://www.sedris.org" target="_top">SEDRIS</a> website contains a lot of information pertaining
        to the SRM which this Quickstart document cannot replace. The website is the place to go when you want to
        make sure that you are choosing the correct coordinate system for the problem you are trying to solve. It is
        the place to go to learn how to use the package org.jscience.mathematics.coordinates. Finally, it is the
        place to go if you need to use the SRM directly.</p>

    <p>JScience <span class="emphasis"><em>uses</em></span> the SRM for all coordinate-related data, but <span
            class="emphasis"><em>permits</em></span> three levels of interaction with it, which you are encouraged
        to pursue in order:</p>

    <div class="orderedlist">
        <ol type="1">
            <li><p>High level interaction for common tasks, which includes:</p>

                <div class="orderedlist">
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li><p>Entry and processing of geolocation data (GPS and map coordinates).</p></li>
                        <li><p>Named access to quantities like Ellipsoids and Datum(s)</p></li>
                        <li><p>Construction of arbitrary 2D and 3D coordinate systems.</p></li>
                    </ol>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li><p>A parallel API to that found in the SEDRIS release. This API wraps the classes in the SEDRIS API
                with classes having identical names. These wrapper classes, which live in the package
                org.jscience.mathematics.coordinates, utilize the Units facility of JScience. Latitudes and
                longitudes have the type Angle, eastings and northings have the type Length, and other quantities
                are manipulated using the appropriate subclass of Quantity. </p></li>
            <li><p>The SEDRIS SRM API itself, in the SRM package. All of the JScience wrapper classes are based on a
                version of the SRM released from SEDRIS, which is included as a jarfile in the JScience release.
                Therefore, if you already have code which uses the SRM directly, it will work with JScience.
                Additionally, if you require some functionality not provided by the JScience wrapper packages you
                can access that functionality directly. </p></li>

    <p>Specifying the position of an object on or near the Earth is a very tricky thing. The bulk of this trickiness
        has its origin in the cartography departments of universities, oil companies, and government entities
        responsible for making maps. You will very shortly find (if you don't already know), that cartographers
        exist in nearly every country. Each cartographer is concerned pretty much exclusively with making maps of
        his or her local area which look nice. Cartographers are not ashamed to "tweak" a coordinate system in order
        to afford their clients some miniscule (and probably undetectable to the untrained eye) benefit over the
        existing system.</p>

    <p>So what does this have to do with you? You have inherited this mess. Suppose, for instance, that you have a
        pair of coordinates in latitude/longitude. You know these coordinates are perfectly accurate, with no error
        whatsoever. Unfortunately, you have no other information, but this should be all you have to know,
        right?</p>

    <p>WRONG! With this information, you know what planet you're on, you know what hemisphere you're in, you know
        what continent you're on, and perhaps the nation, state, and city you occupy. But you don't need a GPS for
        that (usually). These perfect coordinates are missing half of the information required to get you back to
        the burger stand they represent.</p>

    <p>Hold on to your hats, because this is the heinously evil part: One pair of latitude and longitude numbers can
        refer to different places! By this, I don't mean that by plugging in different values to latitude and
        longitude one can eventually refer to all locations one would possibly ever want to go. No. One set of
        numbers, say the numbers you write down off of your GPS when visiting your favorite burger joint, could also
        refer to the naughty nighty store two blocks away. This has only one of two outcomes when your wife checks
        up on you with her GPS, which for some reason has different settings: 1] She becomes excited (until you show
        up with a burger and no nighty); or 2] she becomes irate (wondering who you're buying nighties for). Either
        way you're in the doghouse because <span class="emphasis"><em>you forgot to write down all the position
        information</em></span>.</p>

    <p>The moral of this story is: make sure your coordinates are complete or be prepared to sleep in the
        doghouse.</p></div>
