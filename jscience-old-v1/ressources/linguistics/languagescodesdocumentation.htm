<H2><A NAME="overview"></A>Overview</H2>

<P> In the interest of fostering the uniform identification of all the world's
    language in information systems, SIL International releases for public use the
    system of three-letter codes used in the <I>Ethnologue</I>. This set of codes
    offers a unique identifier for each of the more than 7,000 languages that are
    listed in the <EM>Ethnologue.</EM> Examples of efforts that are already using
    these codes as a standard for language identification are the
    <A HREF="http://www.language-archives.org" TARGET="_blank">Open Language
        Archives Community</A>, the
    <A HREF="http://www.linguistlist.org" TARGET="_blank">Linguist List</A>, and
    the <A HREF="http://www.rosettaproject.org" TARGET="_blank">Rosetta
    Project</A>.</P>

<P>Any application that makes use of these language identifiers is just one
    click away from access to the full language descriptions that are available in
    the <EM>Ethnologue</EM>. That is, for any language identifier XXX that may be
    stored in a database, an application may present a link to the following URL in
    order to give the user access to the <EM>Ethnologue</EM>'s description of that
    language:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=XXX</CODE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The most widely used standard for identifying languages in Internet
    documents (such as in HTTP headers or HTML metadata or in the XML <TT>lang</TT>
    attribute) is <A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3066.txt">RFC 3066</A>. In
    that standard, a three-letter identifier is interpreted as a code from the ISO
    639 standard. That code set has codes for only 381 individual languages. (See
    <A HREF="http://www.ethnologue.com/iso639">elsewhere</A> on this site for the
    mapping between SIL and ISO language codes.) RFC 3066 offers an extension
    mechanism of tags beginning with <TT>x-</TT> to handle custom codes for
    languages not covered in the standard. We recommend the following form for
    constructing an RFC 3066 compliant language tag from the SIL language code XXX:

<P>The remainder of this document, after describing the terms of use for the
    code tables, explains the structure of the code tables, gives some hints on how
    they might be used, and offers links for downloading them.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>We see that AAA and AAB denote living languages spoken in Nigeria, AAC and
    AAD denote living languages spoken in Papua New Guinea, and so on. When a
    language is actually spoken in more than one country, the <TT>CountryId</TT>
    gives the country that is considered primary; usually the country of origin or
    country where most of the speakers are located.</P>

<P><TT>CountryCodes.tab</TT> lists the two-letter identifier and name for 220
    countries of the world. The codes are from the international standard known as
    ISO 3166-1 (1997. <EM>Codes for the representation of names of countries and
    their subdivisions--Part 1: Country codes.</EM> Geneva: International
    Organization on Standardization.

    ). The following shows the entries for the first five codes in the list:</P>

</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The <TT>CountryCodes.tab</TT> table would be used to narrow the search for
    an identifier to a particular country. The user would choose a country from the
    country list in order to select the appropriate country code. That code would
    then be used in a SQL query to restrict the language identifier list to just
    entries for that country. For instance, if the user were interested only in
    Afghanistan, the following SQL query would return just the table rows for that
    country:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><TT>SELECT * FROM LanguageCodes WHERE CountryID='AF'</TT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Alternatively, the following link to the Ethnologue web site could be used
    to generate a report listing all the languages for Afghanistan:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><TT>http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?code=AF</TT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><TT>LanguageIndex.tab</TT> documents 37,420 distinct names used for the
    7,148 languages. The entries in this index of names indicate in which country
    each name is used. The table thus contains 46,416 records since many of the
    names are used in more than one country and some are used with more than one
    language or dialect. The following shows the entries in the name index for the
    first three language identifiers:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>LangID CountryID NameType Name

AAB    NG        LA       Alumu
AAB    NG        D        Arum
AAB    NG        LA       Arum-cesu
AAB    NG        LA       Arum-chessu
AAB    NG        L        Arum-tesu
AAB    NG        D        Tesu
AAC    PG        L        Ari
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>We see that AAA has two alternate names in addition to the primary name of
    Ghotuo. AAB has three alternate names and two dialect names in addition to its
    primary name. AAC has just one name.</P>

<P>The <TT>LanguageIndex.tab</TT> table would be used to implement a search by
    name. For instance, the following query would return the three-letter codes for
    all the languages that use the name <EM>xyz:</EM></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><TT>SELECT DISTINCT LangID FROM LangaugeIndex<BR>
    WHERE Name='xyz' </TT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Note that <TT>DISTINCT</TT> is used since the same language could be known
    by the same name in multiple countries. To allow the user to verify that a
    proposed identifier is indeed the right one, the software would offer the
    following link to the <EM>Ethnologue</EM> web site to see a report giving
    detailed information about the selected language (where XXX is the proposed
    three-letter identifier):</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><TT>http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=XXX</TT>
</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Another application of the <TT>LanguageIndex.tab</TT> table is to find all
    the countries in which a given language is spoken. For instance, the following
    query returns the names of all the countries in which language XXX is spoken:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><TT>SELECT DISTINCT C.Name FROM CountryCodes AS C<BR>
    JOIN LanguageIndex AS L ON C.CountryID=L.CountryID<BR>
    WHERE L.LangID='XXX' </TT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In this case <TT>DISTINCT</TT> must be used since a language could have
    multiple names in a given country.</P>

<P>Finally, the <TT>LanguageIndex.tab</TT> table can be used to learn all the
    languages spoken in a particular country. Whereas the query illustrated
    previously retrieves all languages whose primary country is Afghanistan, the
    following query retrieves all languages spoken in Afghanistan:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><TT>SELECT DISTINCT LangID FROM LanguageIndex<BR>
    WHERE CountryID='AF' </TT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H2><A NAME="Change">Change</A> management</H2>

<P>A new edition of the <EM>Ethnologue</EM> (both in print and on the Web) is
    published approximately every four years. (The 14th edition was published in
    2000; the 15th edition is scheduled for publication in 2004.) Between editions,
    editorial work is on-going and changes affecting the code tables can be made at
    any time. The Web edition of the <EM>Ethnologue</EM> will not reflect these
    changes until the next edition appears. However, beginning in 2002, there will
    be a twice yearly release of an updated language code table that incorporates
    all the changes that have been decided on for the next edition. Users who want
    to keep up-to-date with the latest version of the code set may download these
    updated code tables from this page. (Note, however, that <TT>LanguageIndex.tab
</TT> will not be updated until the 15th edition is produced.) </P>

<P>The fourth table in the set, <TT>ChangeHistory.tab</TT>, documents all the
    changes that have been made in successive versions of <TT>LanguageCodes.tab
</TT>. The first column of <TT>ChangeHistory.tab</TT> specifies the
    three-letter code that has undergone a change. The second column gives the date
    the change was released for download in a revised <TT>LanguageCodes.tab</TT>.
    The third column identifies the kind of change that was made; four kinds of
    changes are tracked by means of a one-letter code:</P>

</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Note that there is not a change type for the case of narrowing the meaning
    of a code, such as when the language denoted by one code is split into two
    languages. In such a case, the original code is retired, and two new codes are
    added. In this way, the user of the code set is assured that once a code has
    been used to tag an item of data, it will continue to be the right code to use
    for as long as the code remains an active member of the code set.</P>

<P><TT>ChangeHistory.tab</TT> is cumulative. Thus it can be queried to discover
    what changes have been made to <TT>LanguageCodes.tab</TT> since a given date.
    For instance, the following SQL query would be used to find out what changes
    have occurred since the beginning of 2002:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><TT>SELECT * FROM ChangeHistory WHERE Date &gt;=2002-01-01</TT>
</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>For sites that have used the SIL three-letter language codes to identify
    languages in their own database applications, an important use of
    <TT>ChangeHistory.tab</TT> is to discover codes used in their data that are now
    obsolete and thus need to be changed. These will be only the codes that have
    been retired. Thus a full list of all data records needing to be changed can be
    found by doing a JOIN on the change history table. For instance, if the column
    named <TT>code</TT> in <TT>MyTable</TT> holds an SIL language code, then the
    following SQL statement will select all records that need to be changed due to
    changes to the code set since the beginning of 2002:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><TT>SELECT * FROM MyTable as M<BR>
    JOIN ChangeHistory as C ON M.code=C.LangID<BR>
    WHERE C.Action='R' AND C.Date &gt;=2002-01-01 </TT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Note that the <TT>Description</TT> field of the joined result set will
    describe what needs to be done to bring the language code up-to-date.</P>

<H2><A NAME="feedback"></A>Giving feedback</H2>

<P>The <I>Ethnologue</I> is a work in progress; our knowledge of the
    world&#146;s languages is always incomplete and subject to improvement. Many
    people who use the <I>Ethnologue</I> can give feedback that will make it better
    and SIL International has always valued this kind of input. Users may have more
    accurate information on details like locations or names or population figures
    or language development status. Or they may be able to provide information that
    would lead to a change to the set of language identifiers. For instance, they
    may be able to show that what is treated as one language is really two, or vice
    versa, or that a listed language does not exist or that an existing language is
    not listed.</P>

<P>If you believe any of the information in the <I>Ethnologue</I> is in error,
    send your proposed change by e-mail to <A
        HREF="mailto:info-sil@sil.org">info-sil@sil.org</A>. Be sure to report the
    source of your information. When you want to request that a language be added
    to the code list because you believe it to be missing altogether, use the
    <A
            HREF="http://www.ethnologue.com/ethno_docs/questionnaires.asp">questionnaires</A>
    supplied on this web site to submit a basic profile of the language.</P>

<P>Before a proposed change is accepted, it must meet two requirements: it
    needs to be in keeping with the criteria for language identification used in
    the <I>Ethnologue</I>, and the facts that lie behind the propsed change need to
    be verified. The verification process may take months as it generally involves
    making enquiries of individuals who are resident in the country where the
    language is spoken. These persons may in turn make enquiries of others in order
    to perform the verification. The submitter can expect to receive an
    acknowledgment from the <I>Ethnologue</I> editor.</P>

<P>The three-letter codes in the range QVA to QZZ are reserved for local use.
    That is, they will never be assigned by SIL International as language
    identifiers. Thus, when users feel that a needed code is missing from the code
    set, they may freely use one of these local use codes as a temporary measure
    until the outcome of a change request is known. </P>
