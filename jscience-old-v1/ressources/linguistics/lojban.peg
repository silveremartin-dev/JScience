; This is a Parsing Expression Grammar for Lojban.
; See http://www.pdos.lcs.mit.edu/~baford/packrat/
; 
; All rules have the form:
; 
; 	name <- peg-expression
; 
; which means that the grammatical construct "name" is parsed using
; "peg-expression".  
; 
; 1)  Names in lower case are grammatical constructs.
; 2)  Names in UPPER CASE are selma'o (lexeme) names, and are terminals.
; 3)  Concatenation is expressed by juxtaposition with no operator symbol.
; 4)  / represents *ORDERED* alternation (choice).  If the first
;     option succeeds, the others will never be checked.
; 5)  ? indicates that the element to the left is optional.
; 6)  * represents optional repetition of the construct to the left.
; 7)  + represents one-or-more repetition of the construct to the left.
; 8)  () serves to indicate the grouping of the other operators.
;
; Longest match wins.
