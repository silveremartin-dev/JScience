This is the initial import of the package from Rene Gressly. There are some changes planned to better integrate
this with other packages. Also we could modify it to take into account other LSystems as defined in
the book of Lindenmayer and Prusinkiewicz which 'The algorithmic beauty of plants'.
The Java3D classes are needed for this package to work.
