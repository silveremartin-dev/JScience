This package is the starting point for an agent simulation package. There is a lot of disagreement on what an agent
should be and how it should work in the litterature. On one hand things that are not agents are treated as such
(autonmous programs in a computer network), on the other hand things that are clearly agents receive very poor treatment
(economic agents for example).<P>
    See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_agent

    Here, the idea is to have multi-agents in a simulated environment as many fine grained similar state machines.
