<h2 align=center>Overview</h2>

<dd>JEOPS is a proposal for an extension of the <a
        href="http://java.sun.com">Java Programming Language</a> with a mechanism
    for embedding first-order, forward-chaining production rules into Java
    applications. It was created to provide the declarative expressiveness of
    production rules to a language whose popularity is growing steadily since
    its creation, but still lacks such a mechanism, that in our opinion is
    a necessary condition to the development of large or complex intelligent
    systems.
<p>
<dd>JEOPS works as a precompiler, translating a set of rules stored in a text
    file into Java classes, that implement a knowledge base governed by
    those rules. For more information, see the <a href="../manual/"
                                                  target="_top">User's Manual</a>.
