Right now there is duplication with org.jscience.media.pictures.filters. 

The idea is that the media package should take care about photoshop like filters whereas this package should provide classes and methods specific to computer vision, which includes some highly tailored filters.

The fact is that I dont understand much in computer vision area so some part of this should probably fall under the media package.

Comments and feedback welcomed.
