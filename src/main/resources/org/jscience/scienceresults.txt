We could offer a file summarizing the main achievements in science. I wasn't able to find a good text on this on the Internet although many probably exist.

A list of these achievements would include:
Planets are spheres,
Planets orbit around stars,
Life evolves by survival and selection,
There is no set of axiom proving the completness of a theory
...

Perhaps with name and date of the discoverer (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_science, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_scientific_discoveries, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_discoveries).

The idea here is not to have a timeline or a list of genius but rather something similar to Pioneer 10 spacecraft plaque (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer_10). In other words what the human race as achieved as milestones, something understandable by about everyone. This would sum in a few pages what we know about nature. We could also point to unsolved questions in science (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unsolved_problems).


This list could be offered not by disciplines but by general biological principles:
health (and reproduction)
shelter
communication (and information and mobility)
resources (including food and energy, economy and business)
tools (and techniques and science)
society (and culture including beliefs and religion)
arts (and spirituality)
child rearing (and education)
environment (and eco sustainability)
power (and relations including government and law)


We may prefer to use Barbara Marx Hubbard
 innovation wheel:
Government and Law
Education
Economy and Business
Health/Relationship/Personal
Science and Technology
Spirituality and Religion
Environment
Culture


It should also be noted that science only makes progress as tools make themselves progress. For example, with the microscope, you can study microbes ; with a telescope you can study stars.
We could therefore also note the main technological discoveries and available resources by period. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_inventions, http://home.entouch.net/dmd/chron.htm
