This is a standalone package where atoms and bonds don't rely on the chemistry package and matrix doesn't rely on the mathematics package.
It provides partial support for reading pdb files and is a quick viewer for these files.
However, as it does not rely on the chemistry package you cannot view your molecules with it.

It is meant to be deprecated and replaced by a viewer with the same functionnality and that rely on subpackages.
May be we will use code from http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/3D/demos/index.html, Tripos Molecular Modeler
