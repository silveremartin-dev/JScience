ISBN format details:
an ISBN is formally broken into 4 parts, and these four parts are supposed to appear separated with hyphens or spaces. In reality, you often see ISBN's with the dashes/spaces stripped
the four parts are:
group/country identifier
publisher identifier
number assigned to a specific title in one format (formally called the title identifier)
a check digit
parts 1, 2 and 3 are variable-length and digits only.
the check digit is a digit or X (which represents 10). The convention is for the x to be capitalized, but you can't count on it.
you can use our java code or the xslt from xfront to calculate the check digit
As noted, 3 hyphens (or spaces; hyphens are recommended) should separate the four parts of the ISBN. Since the last hyphen precedes the check digit, it always goes between the 9th and 10th characters.
The group/country identifiers for each "country" are: 0/1 English - (UK, US, Australia, NZ, Canada,South Africa, Zimbabwe) [Ireland, Puerto Rico, Swaziland]
2 French (France, Belgium, Canada, Switzerland)[and Luxembourg]
3 German (Germany, Austria, Switzerland)

Position of the first digit (or space) -- if the first digit is 0-7, the first separator goes between the 1st and 2nd characters. If it's an 8, it goes between the 2nd and 3rd characters.

If the first two characters are 90-93 the separator goes between the 2nd and 3rd characters. If it's 95, it goes between the 3rd and 4th characters (that is, if the first three characters are 950-959). If the first two characters are 94, it's an invalid ISBN.

Blocks of ISBNs are assigned to publishers in groups of 10, 100, 1000, 10,000, 100,000 or 1,000,000. These carve up the possible ISBNs in an interesting fashion.
For instance, for the largest publishers you could make this calculation -- going from the back, one character for the check digit, 6 for one million titles, and in English-speaking countries, 0 or 1 for the group/country identifier. That leaves 2 digits for the publisher code.

So you might imagine that there are 100 possible publisher codes that could be assigned one million title codes. However, only the first 20 (00-19) have been reserved for such large publishers.

Thus if the first three characters are 015, you know that in fact the first two hyphens should appear as 0-15- ... There are no smaller publishers whose publisher code begins with a 1, and no largest ones that begin with a 2 or greater.

Thus in English we know that: Country  Publisher ID  If number ranges are between:  Insert hyphen after the:  Block Size
0 00.......19 00-19 3rd digit 1,000,000
0 200......699 20-69 4th digit 100,000
0 7000.....8499 70-84 5th digit 10,000
0 85000....89999 85-89 6th digit 1,000
0 900000...949999 90-94 7th digit 100
0 9500000..9999999 95-99 8th digit 10
1 55000....86979 5500-8697 6th digit 1,000
1 869800...998999 8698-9989 7th digit 100
1 9990000..9999999 9990-9999 8th digit 10


That is, for English-speaking countries, we know where the middle hyphen goes because we can tell how long the publisher identifier is by its makeup. The second hyphen goes between the 3rd and 4th characters if the ISBN begins 000-019; between the 4th and 5th characters if it begins 020-069 [which is to say, begins 0200-0699]; and so on.
