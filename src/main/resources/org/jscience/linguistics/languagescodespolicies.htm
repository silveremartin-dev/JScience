<P>These electronic versions of <EM>Ethnologue: Languages of the World,</EM>
    and the <EM>SIL Bibliography</EM> are intended for scholarly research and
    educational use. You may make a copy of portions of these documents for
    research or educational purposes free of charge and without further permission.
    Republication or commercial use of the <EM>Ethnologue</EM> (and its indexes)
    and commercial use of bibliography citations is expressly prohibited without
    the written consent of SIL International. Noncommercial republication of
    bibliography citations is permitted according to the restrictions outlined in
    the <A
        HREF="http://www.ethnologue.com/biblio_docs/biblio_intro.asp#userefs">bibliography
    overview</A>. You may make links to these documents (with proper attribution),
    but you may not mirror (i.e., place copies of) these documents, in part or
    whole, on your site without permission of SIL International. </P>

<H3><A NAME="codes"></A>Terms of Use for SIL Three-letter Language Codes and
    their Mapping to ISO 639 </H3>

<P>In the interest of fostering the uniform identification of all the world's
    languages in information systems, SIL International releases for public use the
    system of three-letter codes used in the <I>Ethnologue</I> as well as their
    mapping to the codes of the ISO 639 standard. You are welcome to download the
    <A HREF="http://www.ethnologue.com/codes/default.asp#downloading">complete code
        set</A> or the <A
        HREF="http://www.ethnologue.com/iso639/default.asp#Download">mappings</A> as
    provided and incorporate the supplied tables into your own database
    application. The 130 codes in the range QVA to QZZ are reserved for local use,
    and you may assign meanings that are specific to your application to codes in
    this range. You are also authorized to make that application available to the
    public, provided that you:</P>
<UL>
    <LI> cite SIL International and this web site (www.ethnologue.com) as the
        source of the information,
    </LI>
    <LI>do not modify or extend the codes other than those set aside for local use,
        and
    </LI>
    <LI>use only the data in the tables and no other data posted on this site.
        Rather, other information on this site should be accessed by supplying a link
        like the following (where XXX is an SIL code and YYY is an ISO code):
        <UL>
            <LI><CODE>http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=XXX</CODE></LI>
            <LI><CODE>http://www.ethnologue.com/show_iso639.asp?code=YYY</CODE></LI>
        </UL>
    </LI>

<P>SIL International maintains the SIL language code set and the ISO 639
    mappings, and intends this site to be the centralized distribution source of
    both in order to ensure uniformity. You are <EM>not</EM> authorized to
    redistribute the downloadable code or mapping tables, whether in the exact form
    they were obtained from this site or in a modified form you have developed,
    without the written consent of
    <A HREF="http://www.ethnologue.com/info.asp#permission">SIL International</A>.
