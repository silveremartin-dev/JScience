Lojban is an artificial, constructed language that is meant to be used by humans. Its grammar is fully formalized. We here provide the YACC and PEG grammars. The YACC grammar is the very official grammar although as many recognize, you can't really produce a parser out of it. We therefore recommend people to use the PEG grammar and morphology.

To read the ISO639 file, please note that one line of text contains one entry. An alpha-3 (bibliographic) code, an alpha-3 (terminologic) code (when given), an alpha-2 code (when given), an English name, and a French name of a language are all separated by pipe (|) characters. The Line terminator is the LF character.
