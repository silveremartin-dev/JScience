This package is the starting point for a complete real time 3D simulation of earth.

Use this package along with org.jscience.astronomy (stars and natural satellite parameters and motion), org.jscience.economics.resources for human made land features, org.jscience.biology for creatures (along with org.jscience.computing.ai.agents).

You can also feed the model with realtime data sources.

Yet, there are things not taken into account:
 high altitude lightning
 interaction of geometry with the rest: for example a tree leaving leaves, an animal with a nest in a tree trunk...
 a way by which fruits would grow
 lava emits light
 the sky has strange colors when the sun is near the horizon
 water is transluscent
 tides support
 waves on the shore
