<body bgcolor="white">The <code>ellipticFunctions</code> package provides a 
library for elliptic functions.
<p>
Some of the most famous mathematicions of the 18<sup>th</sup>-century,
like Abel, Gauss, Jacobi, or Weierstrass, contributed to this subject
and opend a complete new field in mathematics.
</p>
<p>
We compute all elliptic functions in terms of Jacobi's theta functions,
which are implemented as static functions in {@link ellipticFunctions.Elliptic}.
</p>
<p>
{@link ellipticFunctions.Jacobi} is devoted to the Jacobi's elliptic functions: 
<code>sn</code>, <code>cn</code>, and <code>dn</code>. It also includes utillity 
functions to compute back and forth between the different descriptions of the
modulus.
</p>
<p>
An implementation for the different elliptic functions of Weierstrass, will
be added soon.
</p>
<p>
All the functions have a convient and an numerical efficient front-end.
Compare for example {@link #Jacobi.sn(Complex,Complex)} and 
{@link #Jacobi.sn(Complex,Complex,Complex[],Complex)}.
