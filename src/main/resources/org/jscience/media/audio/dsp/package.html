This code is repackaged after the code from Craig A. Lindley, from the book Digital Audio with Java
It was found at ftp://ftp.prenhall.com/pub/ptr/professional_computer_science.w-022/digital_audio/

The book has a very conservative license agreement about the software that comes on the accompanying CDROM.
Although what is found on the Web is a later version and there is no accompanying licence file. Of course,
in that sort of case we usually contact the author who gave us his consent.

Prentice Hall, the editor has given his formal approval that we redistribute this code under GPL.
