/**
 * Provides units and measures for physical quantities with dimensional
 * analysis.
 * <p>
 * This package implements a comprehensive units framework enabling type-safe
 * dimensional analysis at compile time. It supports:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>Type Safety</b> - Quantities are parameterized by their dimension</li>
 * <li><b>Unit Conversions</b> - Automatic conversion between compatible
 * units</li>
 * <li><b>Dimensional Analysis</b> - Compile-time checking of dimensional
 * consistency</li>
 * <li><b>Arbitrary Precision</b> - Uses
