 * A bijective function (one-to-one and onto mapping).

 * A bijection is a function f: D Ã¢â€ â€™ C where:
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>Injective</b> (one-to-one): f(x) = f(y) implies x = y</li>
 * <li><b>Surjective</b> (onto): For every c Ã¢Ë†Ë† C, there exists d Ã¢Ë†Ë† D such that
 * f(d) = c</li>
 * </ul>
 * Every bijection has an inverse function fÃ¢ÂÂ»Ã‚Â¹: C Ã¢â€ â€™ D.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Examples of bijections:</b>
 * <ul>
 * <li>f(x) = 2x (Ã¢â€žÂ Ã¢â€ â€™ Ã¢â€žÂ)</li>
 * <li>f(x) = xÃ‚Â³ (Ã¢â€žÂ Ã¢â€ â€™ Ã¢â€žÂ)</li>
 * <li>exp(x) (Ã¢â€žÂ Ã¢â€ â€™ Ã¢â€žÂÃ¢ÂÂº), inverse is ln(x)</li>
